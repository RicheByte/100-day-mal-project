### 🚨 DISCLAIMER

# ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is intended for **educational and research purposes only**.

It contains samples of malware and exploitation techniques to help students, analysts, and researchers understand how threats work at a low level.

**Do not** run any of these samples on physical systems. Use **isolated virtual environments** only.  
Misuse of this repository may be illegal and unethical.

By using this code, you agree to take full responsibility for how it is used.

### 🎯 Project Goals

- Teach core malware development concepts in a responsible and academic way
    
- Demonstrate common evasion, obfuscation, persistence, and payload techniques
    
- Develop 100 different examples ranging from beginner to advanced
    
- Improve reverse engineering and malware analysis skills
    
- Provide cybersecurity awareness and transparency through code

Each folder contains:

- 📄 **Source code (.c/.cpp)**
    
- 📝 **Mini README** explaining the technique used
    
- 🔐 **Safe payload or placeholder**, never destructive code
    
- 💬 Comments explaining every section

### 🧩 Techniques Covered

- Anti-debugging and sandbox detection
    
- Obfuscation & polymorphism
    
- Process injection (classic, reflective, DLL)
    
- Fileless execution (memory-only)
    
- Keylogging, hooking, and shellcode loaders
    
- Evasion tactics used in real-world malware
    
- Persistence methods (registry, services, startup tasks)
    
- Command-and-control (simulated for research only)
    
- Cryptographic misuse in malware
    
- Packers and custom encryption
    

> 📚 This is a **library of malware behavior**, not a library of threats.

### 🧪 How to Run (Education Only)

- Use inside **VMs only** (VirtualBox/VMware)
    
- Do **NOT** run on production or personal machines
    
- Use tools like:
    
    - x64dbg / OllyDbg (debugging)
        
    - Procmon / Process Hacker (monitoring)
        
    - Wireshark / Fiddler (network behavior)
        
    - Ghidra / IDA Free (reverse engineering)
